## BSBI online Atlas 2020
This repository has two purposes:
1. A repository for a BSBI specific data access Javascript library for use with the online Atlas 2020 project.
2. A repository for test and demonstration pages for that project.

The most of the code for the BSBI Atlas project is stored elsewhere in BRC general libraries for Atlas projects, e.g:

- The BRC Atlas library (https://github.com/BiologicalRecordsCentre/brc-atlas)
- The BRC British Isles Grid Reference library (https://github.com/BiologicalRecordsCentre/brc-atlas-bigr)

The data access library in this project includes only the code which is specific to BSBI use of the aforementioned resources.
