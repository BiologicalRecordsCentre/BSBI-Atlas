## BSBI online Atlas 2020
This repository has two purposes hosts some early development and demonstration code for the BSBI 2020 Atlas. It was previously also a repository for data access functions required for use with [the BRC Atlas library](https://biologicalrecordscentre.github.io/brc-atlas) the the BSBI 2020 Atlas. Those data access functions are now incorporated into the [BSBI Drupal 8 module](https://github.com/BiologicalRecordsCentre/bsbi-atlas-drupal8) and removed from this project.
