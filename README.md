## BSBI online Atlas 2020
This repository has two purposes hosts some early development and demonstration code for the BSBI 2020 Atlas. It was previously also a repository for data access functions required for use with the BRC Atlas library which is one of the building blocks for  the BSBI 2020 Atlas. Those data access functions are now incorporated into the [BSBI Drupal 8 module](https://github.com/BiologicalRecordsCentre/bsbi-atlas-drupal8) and removed from this project.

Other repos associated with the BSBI Atlas 2020 project are:

- [The BRC British Isles Grid Reference library](https://biologicalrecordscentre.github.io/brc-atlas-bigr)
- [The BRC Atlas library](https://biologicalrecordscentre.github.io/brc-atlas)
- [The BRC Atlas Drupal module](https://github.com/BiologicalRecordsCentre/brc-atlas-drupal8)

To see the the early demonstration examples housed in this repo, use the links below from the associated [GitHub 'pages'](https://biologicalrecordscentre.github.io/BSBI-Atlas/). Note that the examples in this repo do *not* use the up-to-date code stored in the other repos referenced above. In general they reference specific early versions of those libraries. To see which versions they reference, check the `<script src=...>` tags in the examples. It is unlikely that any of the examples in this repo would work with the most recent versions of the libraries.
